# Errbit to Errbit-NG migration guide

## From Errbit main to Errbit-NG 0.1.0

In current moment, errbit-ng should be drop in replacement for errbit.
With few exceptions:

1. Default port (`PORT` env) changed to 3000 (sync rails defaults) for puma.
2. Default port in docker image is changed to 3000 (sync with rails defaults).
3. It should be safe just remove `PORT` env from any configurations.
4. You should not set `RACK_ENV` env if you don't know for what. It should be removed from any configurations.
5. `MAX_THREADS` env was removed. Use default rails `RAILS_MAX_THREADS` and `RAILS_MIN_THREADS`.
6. Add `RAILS_LOG_LEVEL` env with default `info`.
7. `RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT` env was drop without replacement. This is default behavior now.
8. Add default rails health check at `/up`.
9. Drop `/health/readiness` in favor `/up`.
10. Drop `/health/liveness` in favor `/up`.
